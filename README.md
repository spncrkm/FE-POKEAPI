# POKEAPI

Welcome to my Pokeapi project! This project showcases what we've learned utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5 and implemented responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features

- Intro page: Embedded a video of a pokemon video and gave it a cinematic feel. From there you can enter into the main page.
- Main page: Search bar to enter a pokemon and will pull data from the pokeapi to give specific information
  - Implemented transitions to cards after you enter in a pokemon.
  - Delete function added to delete cards after it is pulled up.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- Bootstrap 5: For responsive layout and components.
